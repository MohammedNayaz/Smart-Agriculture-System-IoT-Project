To deliver integrated Internet of Things industry salutation for enterprises that offer speed market, security and scalability.

2.2 Overview
Harness the power of the Internet of Things
Through their strategic relationship, Tequed Labs help enterprises harness the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and advance analytics using world-class assets, capabilities and global resources of their combined organizations. Specifically, they draw on Tequed Lab’s transformative horizontal and industry-specific IoT solutions integrated with Microsoft Azure IoT Suite to provide their clients with turnkey IoT Solutions-as-a-Service, along with the enabling cloud infrastructure and software stack. According to Tequed Lab Research, executives believe the IoT will impact many areas of their business in the next three years.

What do they do: -
Their comprehensive solutions enable enterprises across a broad range of industries to realize the benefits of IoT through a proven, industrialized approach offering speed to market, security, and scalability.
•	Connected Asset Management empowers enterprises across multiple industries including large industrial and manufacturing companies, oil and gas facilities, and OEMs-to proactively manage their assets, make quicker and move informed decisions and optimize business processes by unlocking=g digital content, specializes analytic and prescriptive actions and insights.
•	Connected Mine helps mining companies connect operations from mine-to-market, maximize existing assets and investments and reduce operating costs.
•	Connected Fleet enables enterprises to track an entire fleet in real-time, manage logistics, improve driving behaviours, increase operational efficiency and help maximize the total value of the fleet lifecycle through the power of telematics.
•	Connected campus helps enterprises, hotels, hospitals and other large venues improve their facility management process by combining and integrating multiple functions into a single, integrated solution with preconfigured digital service, including management of office space and buildings, access and security, value added service (e.g., Taxis, parking), way finding, energy and sustainability as well as and health and safety.

Tequed Labs is very keen in developing IOT products because they believe that IOT-enabled products will soon touch every aspect of our physical lives. They work with a thought process the today we already have sensor-equipped industrial equipment powered by AI.
Medical devices that self-diagnose and send alters to their operators. Automobiles that engage new features and improve efficiency by updating their software. And very soon refrigerators that help you figure out what you could have for dinner and ovens that know how to cook it.
They keep in mind that whatever your industry and whatever customers you serve, the key to succeeding in the new world of digital is getting your best ideas to market that connect you with the physical world.
